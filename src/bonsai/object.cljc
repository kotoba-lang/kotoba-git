  "Content-addressed blob/tree/commit object model — the git-equivalent
   layer — represented as native arrangement (Datomic-shaped) datoms
   rather than a separate content-addressed block store. A blob/tree/
   commit's subject IS its own content hash; io-multiformats/io-ipld
   contribute only their pure canonical-encoding/hashing functions
   (cidv1-raw, encode, cid) to derive that identity — nothing is
   persisted through them. Persisting a repo's whole datom set (objects
   and refs together) to durable storage is bonsai.repo/persist!'s
