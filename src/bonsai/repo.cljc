  "A repo is a single arrangement db holding both objects
   (bonsai.object) and refs (bonsai.refs) as quads — git is not a
   separate content-addressed store bolted onto the Datomic-shaped
   kotobase-peer stack, it is a schema within it. Object subjects are
   content hashes (blob/tree/commit CIDs); ref subjects are repo ids —
   disjoint subject namespaces, so both coexist in one db without
   collision."
